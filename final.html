			<h3>Summary of the Dataset:</h3>

			<p>Today, the phrase “You have a choice,” cannot be said with confidence. This dataset looks at the number of abortions performed within each U.S. State-further categorized by age range and year. The years analyzed include a decade's difference of 2010 and 2020. Now more than ever, abortion attains prominence as legal conflicts persist. On June 24, 2022, Roe v. Wade was overturned, taking away the female right to abortion. Additionally, the availability of birth control is being stripped by certain states.</p>
			<p>My findings deem newsworthy as they can depict the results of similar legal challenges within the past decade. It's critical to analyze such data as it reveals progression and regression regarding women's reproductive rights-a battle being fought since the 1900’s. <p>

			<h3>Findings:</h3>
			<p>For my first finding, I wanted to look at a Republican state with notorious anti-abortion views- Alabama. I found that 1.8 times more women in Alabama got abortions in 2010 than in 2020. While abortion was still, technically, legal in 2020, this decrease represents the influence of external factors such as a lack of state clinics and an increased contraceptive use.</p>

			</script>
			<br>
			<p>To contrast such, I wanted to look at a democratic state-Illinois. I also specifically wanted to look into the age range of 25-29, as that is a common age for child-bearing. Compared to 2010, in 2020 there was a 55.5% increase in abortion in the state of Illinois for the age range of 25-29. <p>

			</script>
			<br>
			<p>I also found that the state with the most abortions in 2010 was New York (83,430) and in 2020 it was Florida (74,740). While both of these states have seemingly large populations they differ in political party, which influences abortion choices. Florida is a Republican state in which abortion is currently banned at 15 weeks and  6 days of pregnancy.  Therefore, I was surprised that Florida's rate was so significant, as it differs from the trends of my combined findings. <p>
			<p>Lastly, I wanted to look at the difference in abortion rates from the range of 20-24 and 25-29. I found that Women aged 20-24 are 1.1 times more likely to get an abortion than at age 25-29, based on data from both years. According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/childbearing-age">Healthline</a>, “Experts say the best time to get pregnant is between your late 20s and early 30s. This age range is associated with the best outcomes for both you and your baby.” As women, moreso, pursue pregnancy in their late 20’s it makes sense why the abortion rate would be higher during 20-24. <p>

			<h3>More Insight of the Issue:</h3>
			<p> Within this data analysis, I wanted to look into the reasoning behind such trends. An article from Guttmacher in 2019 explains the reasons for decreased abortion rates. “… the 2011–2017 period warrants particular attention because it coincided with an unprecedented wave of new abortion restrictions. During that time frame, 32 states enacted a total of 394 new restrictions.” Therefore, clinic closures and an overall inaccessibility remain a reason for decline. Aside from legislation, there are other factors such as increased contraceptive use. “Since 2011, contraception has become more accessible, as most private health insurance plans are now required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to cover contraceptives without out-of-pocket costs.” Then again, some of my data depicts an increase, such as the Illinois finding. According to the New York Times, “Many organizations are still encouraging patients who cannot seek an abortion in their home state to travel across state lines to receive care…” Therefore, the Illinois increase could be due to travelers from other states with restrictions. </p>
			<p>I had the opportunity to speak with an Obstetrician Gynecologist, who is a practicing physician at a safety-net hospital in the Northside of Chicago. She has asked to remain anonymous due to the political climate of abortion. She believes that abortion is a minimum right and that no one should be able to dictate what women can and cannot do with their bodies. She discussed the difference amongst state laws. “The law is so strict. I think in Texas, if I am correct, the law is that after 6 or 7 weeks you can't abort-most people don’t even know that they are pregnant at 6 weeks. Contrastingly, where she works in Illinois, a democratic state, she explained that most OBGYN’s value the health of women. In relation to high rates in democratic states, she agreed that most women do travel for the procedure if needed. “The rate depends on the state because of legal issues. For example, bordering democratic states will obviously have rates that go up.” She also said, “ When Trump won the election, more women ranging from age of 20-25 came in for IUDs when they were scared about changing legislation.” This represents the impact of legislation and advanced contraception on abortion rates.</p>

			<h3>Limitations:</h3>
			<p>While my dataset provided me with an exceptional baseline for analysis, I found a few issues with it. There was the case that a few states were not documented in both of the years. For example, Florida was only documented by the CDC in 2020-not in 2010. However, I was still able to use its 2020 value, as part of a finding. Another limitation, in my perception, was the impact the COVID-19 had on 2020. Depending on the person, it may have heightened or reduced the need for abortion. Therefore, one may question if this data is a proper representation of a decades impact. </p>

			<h3>Moving Forward:</h3>
			<p>These increases and decreases truly represent the power that politics plays, in regard to reproductive rights. Therefore, it’s critical to acknowledge these trends and the reasoning behind them as abortion, as “the choice” must be continued for women's healthcare and overall being. </p>
